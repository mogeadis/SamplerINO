## Description

### Project
**SamplerINO** utilizes an *ATmega32U4* microcontroller and two *CAP1188* 8-channel capacitive touch sensor modules to assemble a USB MIDI controller featuring 16 touch-sensitive pads. The prototype circuit board is housed inside a custom-designed 3D printed enclosure, which facilitates the installation of the pads, as well as an LED indicator and a power switch. You can watch a video demonstration of this hardware MIDI controller and its dedicated software sampler at the following [link](https://www.youtube.com).

### Repository
The code in this repository is organized into several directories, with the source (`.cpp`) files, header (`.h`) files, and external libraries of the controller located in the [*src*](src), [*include*](include), and [*lib*](lib) directories, respectively. The *Max* patch implementing the user interface of the accompanying sampler, along with a collection of drum samples gathered from various royalty-free web sources, are contained in the [*max*](max) directory. Lastly, all hardware-related files (i.e. the circuit diagram and the 3D model designs) are located in the [*hw*](hw) directory, while the [*img*](img) directory contains all images displayed in the present documentation.

### Technical Details
This project was developed using `Max 8.1.11` and *Visual Studio Code* on `Windows 10`, with the *PlatformIO* extension employed to upload the code to the *ATmega32U4* microcontroller embedded in an *Arduino*-compatible *Pro Micro* board. The controller pads were made by cutting 4√ó4cm pieces from a 0.5mm thick copper sheet, while the enclosure screw holes were designed for M2 threaded heat inserts. Lastly, a common anode RGB LED was used for the LED indicator.
